# League of Legends World Championship Series Project

This project is to focus on some analysis for the League of Legends Worlds Championship Series 2019. I am focusing on the champions picks and bans, and focusing on three questions.
<br/>
1. Which Champions where most popular per role
2. For the most common champions, did their popularity change during the duration of worlds.
3. On average what was the most common team that was picked overall and by each team.

<br/>
I currently have the dataset for picks and bans all ready to use and make subset dataset to answer this questions. Now its a matter of doing the visualization of the questions and see if we can answer these questions.
<br/>
<br/>
During the process some questions will change or some question will be add and that will be in the markdown for each analysis but those are the three questions that started this project.
