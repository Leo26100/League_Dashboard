# League Tournament Dashboard  

This projected shifted from focusing on analyzing worlds data to create dashboard pages from datasets for all the league tournaments that have happened this year. Currently working on the layout of the dashboard. Will update README to show the lay of the dashboard. I will make a page the focuses on Worlds/International tournaments.



# Running the program and goals

Right now it is incomplate but [prototype.pdf](https://github.com/Leo26100/League_Dashboard/blob/further-modifying-bot-lane/Prototype.pdf) shows a pdf of how the page looks like for right now.

Next shift is tidying the data for Tournament. I would want this table to give real time results of the tournament with interesting stats. I envision the tale to have this type of format.
