# League Tournament Dashboard  

This projected shifted from focusing on analyzing worlds data to create dashboard pages from datasets for all the league tournaments that have happened this year. Currently working on the layout of the dashboard. Will update README to show the lay of the dashboard. I will make a page the focuses on Worlds/International tournaments.


# Crucial Updates Needed
* Changed tables from TournamentResults to a up to date table rather than wait till the end of the split to have the results.
* Other Tables working properly so for the mean time take out any display of that table in app and replace it once found the best table for the displaying standings for tournament
