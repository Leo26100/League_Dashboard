# Worlds_2019

This is my attempt to analyze the league of legends world championship 2019. I will have both code in R and Python however, I am more familiar with R.
</br>
</br>
In the R Code I have two data sets ready: Picks and Bans, while I am working on a third one match history by player. For this one I am hoping to tidy the match history by player to join it to the Pics/Bans data set.
</br>
</br>
In the python, I am replicating the data set and as well just playing around to get more familiar to pandas/python.
</br>
</br>
Once all the data sets are complete, my hope is to do analysis on the champions to see the priority throughout the tournament and as well player performance throughout the tournament. Will try to find statements or analysis that other players/coaches had (although it will be hard) and see if they have evidence to support their statements.
